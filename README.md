### How this project works (simple explanation)

This project simulates an intelligent engine that analyzes business processes.

You describe a process with steps, duration, and whether they are manual or automatic.

The system:
- Identifies slow steps (bottlenecks)
- Detects manual tasks that could be automated
- Returns a structured analysis

This project demonstrates process analysis, automation mindset, and API design.
